Assignment: 

Modify the notebook in this folder to visualize the pageviews of Wikipedia articles. You will have to review [the API documentation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end).

You should e-mail me a link to a notebook in a GitHub repo or on PAWS that collects data from the Wikipedia pageview API and creates the following results:
1. Pageviews for an article of your choice on English Wikipedia, plotted daily, for the calendar year 2020
2. All pageviews to English Wikipedia, plotted monthly, for 2017-2020: 
2a. For mobile web devices only 
2b. For desktop devices only 
2c. For web spiders (aka crawlers/scrapers) only
3. The top 10 most viewed articles on the same day of your choice, in at least five different language versions of Wikipedia (only needs to be a simple table or list, not a visualization)
